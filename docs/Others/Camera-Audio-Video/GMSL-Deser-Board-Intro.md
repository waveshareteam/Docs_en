# About GMSL Deser Board
The GMSL deserialization board is a high-speed serial link receiver module integrated with the MAX9296 chip, designed specifically for in-vehicle ADAS, machine vision and other scenarios. It is core-compatible with GMSL Generation 1/2 protocols and enables long-distance transmission and parsing of high-definition video streams and control signals.

As a flagship deserialzer chip from ADI/Maxim, the MAX9296 supports a single-channel rate of 6Gbps or dual-channel rates of 3Gbps each, and is compatible with HDMI/CSI-2 output. It can accurately decode video data transmitted by GMSL serializers (e.g., the MAX9295). The board integrates PoC power supply and an I2C reverse control channel, supports multi-camera address assignment and virtual channel mapping, and can be directly connected to main control platforms such as Jetson Orin and Raspberry Pi.

Boasting an industrial-grade design, it features 1kV isolation voltage withstanding capacity and high EMI resistance, with a transmission distance of up to 15 meters. It is adapted to the 12V in-vehicle power supply and a wide temperature range of -40℃~85℃, serving as a core link solution for scenarios such as autonomous driving surround view systems and in-vehicle instrument displays.
