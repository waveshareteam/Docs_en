The ESP32-C6 is Espressif's first SoC supporting Wi-Fi 6, integrating 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5 (LE), and 802.15.4 protocols. It provides IoT products with industry-leading RF performance, comprehensive security mechanisms, and abundant memory resources. It features a high-performance 32-bit RISC-V processor clocked up to 160 MHz and a low-power 32-bit RISC-V processor clocked up to 20 MHz, with built-in 512 KB SRAM, 320 KB ROM, and support for external flash. The ESP32-C6 has 30 (QFN40) or 22 (QFN32) programmable GPIO pins, supporting SPI, UART, I2C, I2S, RMT, TWAI, PWM, Motor Control PWM, and SDIO. It also integrates a 12-bit ADC and a temperature sensor.
