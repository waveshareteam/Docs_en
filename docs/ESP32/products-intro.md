# Waveshare ESP32 Series Product

ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power System-on-Chip (SoC) with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, developed by Espressif Systems. With its powerful performance and rich peripheral interfaces, the ESP32 has become a popular choice for Internet of Things (IoT) projects and smart device development.

Waveshare Electronics has launched a series of development boards and modules based on the ESP32 series chips to meet diverse development needs. The product line covers everything from basic core boards to various display modules featuring touch screens and E-Ink screens, as well as expansion boards tailored for AIoT and robotic control applications. This Wiki provides introductory tutorials, user manuals, and open-source example codes for these hardware products. We are committed to offering stable and reliable hardware which, combined with the tutorials and examples provided here, aims to eliminate hardware barriers, shorten development cycles, and allow you to focus on application implementation and creative realization.
