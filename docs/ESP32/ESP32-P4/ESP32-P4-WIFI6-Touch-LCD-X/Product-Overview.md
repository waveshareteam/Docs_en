## Development Tools

Each of these two development approaches has its own advantages, and developers can choose according to their needs and skill levels. Arduino is suitable for beginners and non-professionals because they are easy to learn and quick to get started. ESP-IDF is a better choice for developers with a professional background or high performance requirements, as it provides more advanced development tools and greater control capabilities for the development of complex projects.
:::warning
Due to the limited support for ESP32-P4 on the Arduino platform, ESP-IDF is currently recommended for development.
:::
- **ESP-IDF**, or full name Espressif IDE, is a professional development framework introduced by Espressif Technology for the ESP series chips. It is developed using the C language, including a compiler, debugger, and flashing tool, etc., and can be developed via the command lines or through an integrated development environment (such as Visual Studio Code with the Espressif IDF plugin). The plugin offers features such as code navigation, project management, and debugging, etc. We recommend using VS Code for development. For the specific configuration process, please refer to the **[Working with ESP-IDF](./ESP-IDF.md)**. The tutorial also provides relevant demos for reference.
