This section showcases several comprehensive projects built using MicroPython. These projects allow you to apply the knowledge gained in previous chapters to practical scenarios.

- [**Traffic Light**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/MicroPython-Tutorials/12-1-Traffic-Light.md): Controls multiple LEDs to simulate the timing logic of traffic signals.
- [**SOS**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/MicroPython-Tutorials/12-2-SOS.md): Controls a buzzer and an LED to emit SOS Morse code signals.
- [**Motion Sensor Light**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/MicroPython-Tutorials/12-3-Presence-Light.md): Uses a PIR sensor to detect human motion and control a WS2812 LED strip.
- [**Fun LED Strip**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/MicroPython-Tutorials/12-4-LED-Strip.md): Uses a potentiometer to control the color-changing effects of a WS2812 LED strip in real-time.
- [**Interactive Progress Bar**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/MicroPython-Tutorials/12-5-Progress-Bar.md): Uses a potentiometer to control the progress bar and gauge effects displayed on an OLED screen in real-time.
- [**Internet Weather Display**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/MicroPython-Tutorials/12-6-Weather-Display.md): Connects to the Seniverse Weather API via Wi-Fi to retrieve real-time weather data and displays it on an OLED screen.
