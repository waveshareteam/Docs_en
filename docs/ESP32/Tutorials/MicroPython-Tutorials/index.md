# ESP32 MicroPython Getting Started

Welcome to the Waveshare ESP32 MicroPython Getting Started!

This tutorial series is based on the Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero Mini Development Board and the Thonny IDE environment, aiming to help learners get started with ESP32 development. It is recommended to follow the chapters in order, but you can also choose specific chapters based on your interests. To ensure a consistent learning experience, it is recommended to use a development board based on the ESP32-S3 chip.

:::tip[Important Note on Board Compatibility]
The core logic of this tutorial applies to all ESP32 boards, but all the operation steps are explained using the example of the [**Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero mini development board**](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-zero.htm). If you are using a development board of another model, please modify the corresponding settings according to the actual situation.

If you are using a different model of ESP32 development board, please note the following:

- **Different Pin Definitions**: Pin numbers and functional layouts will vary across boards.
- **Different Onboard Resources**: For example, your board may use LEDs with different pins or may not have onboard RGB LEDs.

**Before running any demo that interacts with hardware, be sure to check and modify the pin numbers in the code according to the pinout diagram of your specific development board to ensure the program runs correctly.**
