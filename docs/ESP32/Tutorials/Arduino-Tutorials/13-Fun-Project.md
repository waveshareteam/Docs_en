This section showcases several comprehensive projects created using Arduino programming. Through these projects, you can apply the knowledge points learned from previous chapters to practical applications.

- [**Traffic Light**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/Arduino-Tutorials/13-1-Traffic-Light.md): Controls multiple LEDs to simulate the sequential logic of a traffic signal.
- [**SOS**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/Arduino-Tutorials/13-2-SOS.md): Controls a buzzer and an LED to emit the SOS Morse code signal.
- [**Motion Sensor Light**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/Arduino-Tutorials/13-3-Presence-Light.md): Uses a PIR sensor to detect human motion and controls a WS2812 LED strip.
- [**LED Strip**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/Arduino-Tutorials/13-4-LED-Strip.md): Uses a potentiometer to control the color-changing effects of a WS2812 LED strip in real-time.
- [**Progress Bar**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/Arduino-Tutorials/13-5-Progress-Bar.md): Uses a potentiometer to control the progress bar and gauge displayed on an OLED screen in real-time.
- [**Weather Display**](/docs/ESP32/Tutorials/Arduino-Tutorials/13-6-Weather-Display.md): Connects to the Seniverse Weather API via Wi-Fi to obtain real-time weather data and displays it on an OLED screen.
