# ESP-IDF Getting Started

Welcome to the Waveshare ESP-IDF Getting Started Tutorial!

This tutorial is designed to help developers quickly become familiar with the basic concepts of ESP-IDF and get started with development. It covers topics such as environment setup, project creation, component usage, and peripheral programming, helping you take the first step in ESP-IDF programming.

:::tip[Important Note: Hardware and Software Versions]
**Hardware**: The core logic of this tutorial applies to all ESP32 development boards. However, all operational steps are explained using the [**Waveshare ESP32-S3-Zero Mini Development Board**](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-zero.htm) ([Product Documentation](https://docs.waveshare.com/ESP32-S3-Zero)) as an example. If you are using a development board of another model, please modify the corresponding settings according to the actual situation. It is recommended to use a development board based on **ESP32-S3** for a consistent learning experience.

**Software**: This tutorial is based on **ESP-IDF v5.5**. ESP-IDF is continuously updated, and there may be API or project configuration compatibility issues between major versions. ESP-IDF uses [Semantic Versioning](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/versions.html#versioning-scheme). Minor versions are generally compatible with each other. To ensure code reproducibility, it is recommended to use the same version as this tutorial or an **ESP-IDF v5.5.x** version.
