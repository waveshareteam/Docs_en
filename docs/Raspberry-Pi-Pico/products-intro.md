# Raspberry Pi Pico Series Product Description

Raspberry Pi Pico is a high-performance, low-power microcontroller launched by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It integrates a wealth of peripheral interfaces, features flexible expandability and a user-friendly development ecosystem, and is widely applicable to the development of smart hardware, the Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded systems.

Waveshare has launched a full range of development boards and modules based on Raspberry Pi RP series chips (RP2040/RP2350) to meet diverse development needs. Our product line covers basic core boards, touch screen and e-Paper screen modules with display functions, as well as expansion boards for applications such as AIoT, robot control and data acquisition. This Wiki provides supporting getting-started tutorials, user guides and open-source sample codes for these hardware products. We are committed to delivering highly reliable hardware, and with the support of our tutorials and samples, we help you get started quickly, shorten development cycles, and let you focus on creativity and application implementation.
