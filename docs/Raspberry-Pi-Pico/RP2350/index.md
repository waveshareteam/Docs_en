The RP2350 is a high-performance, low-power microcontroller introduced by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It features a unique dual-core, dual-architecture design, integrating dual-core ARM Cortex-M33 and dual-core Hazard3 RISC-V processors, both running at up to 150 MHz, allowing users to flexibly switch between the two architectures. The chip incorporates 520 KB of high-speed SRAM, 12 PIO state machines, and a rich set of communication interfaces (HSTX, UART, SPI, I²C, PWM, ADC, USB). It is equipped with a temperature sensor for real-time chip temperature monitoring and provides powerful expansion capabilities and hardware security features. The RP2350 is widely applicable for smart hardware, Internet of Things (IoT), and various embedded systems development.
