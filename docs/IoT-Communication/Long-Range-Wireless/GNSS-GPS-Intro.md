# About GNSS/GPS

Satellite Navigation/Positioning Modules are core components for devices to obtain precise spatiotemporal information, supporting major global navigation satellite systems such as GPS, BDS, GLONASS, and Galileo. These modules feature high sensitivity, fast positioning, and stable tracking capabilities, offering positioning solutions with different accuracies ranging from meter-level to centimeter-level. They can also integrate enhanced technologies like inertial navigation and RTK differential correction. They are widely applied in vehicle navigation, asset tracking, drone flight control, precision agriculture, and wearable devices, providing a reliable foundation for location awareness and navigation services in various mobile terminals and IoT systems.
