<Details summary="Q: What is the positioning error when using the base station positioning module with the node module?" className="faq-details" open>
  A: This module is an RTK centimeter-level positioning module. Positioning accuracy varies in different environments:
  - In actual measurements, it can reach 20 cm; in ideal environments, the error can be even smaller. The error varies in different environments.
  - If tested using shared demos and free base station server, the error is typically larger; because error increases with distance from the base station, it is recommended to purchase/use operator base station services for a more precise positioning experience.
