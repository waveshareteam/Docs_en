# About Long-Range Wireless Communication

Long-range wireless communication is a technology that utilizes radio waves for data transmission to achieve cross-regional, long-distance information connectivity. It features wide coverage, flexible deployment, strong anti-interference capability, and eliminates the need for wiring. This technology is widely used in fields such as the Internet of Things (IoT), industrial monitoring, smart cities, and remote control, enabling stable transmission of sensor data and control information in complex environments. Depending on the application scenario, it can be categorized into cellular communication (e.g., 4G/5G), low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN, e.g., LoRa, NB-IoT), as well as satellite communication and positioning. It meets diverse requirements ranging from low-speed, small data transmissions to high-speed, real-time communications.
